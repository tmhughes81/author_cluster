			<h2>How are the clusters calculated?</h2>
			<p>The short answer is running the documents through TF-IDF, and then
			reducing the dimensionality down to two by using LSA.  The dimensionality
			reduction allows the clusters to be visualized in two dimensional space.</p>
			<p>If you are not familiar with those techniques, keep reading.</p>

			<h2>What is TF-IDF?</h2>
			<p>It stands for "Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency."
			In essence, the algorithm will take a total of how often each
			word in a document occurs (the term frequency).  That number is
			then weighted against how rarely that term appears across all of
			the documents in the corpus.</p>
			<p>You don't just want to use the term frequency, because then you
			would get a large number of very common words that are present in
			every document.  Such words do not tell us much about what is
			distinctive about a particular document.  By weighting by the
			inverse document frequency, words that are common in a single
			document, but rare across the corpus, must be distinctive and
			important for this document.</p>
			
			<h2>What is LSA?</h2>
			
			LSA stands for "Latent Semantic Analysis."  Sometimes it is also
			referred to as "truncated singular value decomposition."  It is
			a technique that is known to deal with the fact that words often
			have multiple meanings.  It can also be utilized, as we are here,
			to reduce the number of dimensions from the results of the
			TF-IDF algorithm.</p>
			
			<p>In machine learning, each unique word from the document would be
			treated as its own dimension.  Thus, if a document has 3,000 unique
			words, the result from the TF-IDF would be a value containing
			3,000 dimensions.  Visualizing such a space is practically impossible.
			Thus, to visualize the results of the TF-IDF, LSA allows us to
			reduce the number of dimensions down to two.  This allows the
			creation of the scatterplots we provide in the visualizations.</p>
			
			<p>A proper technical explanation, including the math, can be found
			<a href=http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/decomposition.html#lsa>
			here</a>.</p>
			
			<h2>What library is being used for the clustering</h2>
			
			<p>This project utilizes <a href="http://scikit-learn.org">
			SciKit-Learn</a> to perform the TF-IDF and the LSA.</p>
			
			<p>The visualizations are done in Python using 
			<a href=http://matplotlib.org> matplotlib</a>.</p>
